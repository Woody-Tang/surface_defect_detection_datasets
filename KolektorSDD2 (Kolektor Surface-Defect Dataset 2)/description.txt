The dataset is constructed from images of defected production items that were provided and annotated by Kolektor Group d.o.o.. Various types of defects were observed on the surface of the item. The images were captured in a controlled industrial environment.

The dataset consists of:

    356 images with visible defects
    2979 images without any defect
    image sizes of approximately 230 x 630 pixels
    train set with 246 positive and 2085 negative images
    test set with 110 positive and 894 negative images
    several different types of defects (scratches, minor spots, surface imperfections, etc.)
