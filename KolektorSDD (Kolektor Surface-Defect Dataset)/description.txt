The dataset is constructed from images of defective production items that were provided and annotated by Kolektor Group d.o.o.. The images were captured in a controlled industrial environment in a real-world case.

The dataset consists of:

    399 images:
        52 images with visible defects
        347 images without any defect
    Original images of sizes:
        width: 500 px
        height: from 1240 to 1270 px
    For training and evaluation images should be resized to 512 x 1408 px

For each item, the defect is only visible in at least one image, while two items have defects on two images, which means there were 52 images where the defects are visible. The remaining 347 images serve as negative examples with non-defective surfaces.
